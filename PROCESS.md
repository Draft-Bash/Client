# About Our Process

## Software Development
The team at Draft Bash utilizes a Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) known as Scrum. This SDLC utilizes 2-week windows, known as Sprints to add features to the product.

## 16-week Timeline
Sprint planning will happen every first Tuesday of a sprint at 2:00 PM, online or in-person. They will be primarily online.
Code review and demos will happen every second Thursday of the sprint at 2:00 PM, online or in-person. They will be primarily online.
On the second Friday of the sprint, stories that are done (demoed and reviewed) will be deployed to production.
We will also have retrospectives on Friday at 3:00 PM. This will usually be done online.

Reflection on improvements made since Sprint 1:
  We improved the security of the app, especially on the server side. Files with important information, such as database credentials, are 
  listed in a .gitignore file so that they are not included in our repository/organization when changes are pushed. The environmental 
  variables for the testing and production environments have been set.
