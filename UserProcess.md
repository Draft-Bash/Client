# User Testing, Process, & Configuration

### User Testing
- Once a new feature is determined by the developers to be ready for public testing, that feature will be added to the test branch through a pull request, which will then be pushed to the testing application automatically through the CI/CD pipeline, where end-users can begin testing the new "Beta" feature.
- Once the new is thoroughly tested in the test application, if it is determiend to be stable, it will then be pushed to the main branch, where it will undergo additional testing before officially being implemented as a new feature to the application

### Process
- The process for the end-users is very simple. They will be given two links:
  1. The URL to the test application where they can get first access to and test the latest features being implemented to Draftbash
  https://draftbash-testing.web.app
  2. The URL to the production application where they can enjoy a more stable application where only the thoroughly tested features are implemented for a smoother user-experience

### Configuration
- Our product's architecture ensures constant integration and constant development for our customers to enjoy. The moment a feature is added to either the test or production environment, our customers will then be able to enjoy and test out the new feature.
